-  nodejs - how to send html
-  create server
-  Socket
-  Stream
-  Load balancer
-  Call one api Inside that  two api calls Concatenate two api response and Send back to api
-  What is process 
- 2 node server and api request hitting server 1 if more capacity then it should redireact to 2nd server? how
  - horizontal some cluster type , vertical or load balancer
-  If we want to import one variable from package how can we do it - Eg axios install, them import and use it
- Event loop in node js
- What is cluster - when resource is fully occupied we use cluster
- Architecture of node js
- Reactor pattern ? used for de multiplexer input output operation
- Middleware in node js- https
- Libuv library in node js
- Error first callback
- What is thread pool and which library handles thread pool
- If I upload 1gb in nodesjs how do you handle it - express-upload-post request and check the file sizeHow do handle If you use read Stream for 1 gb
- Middle wehre used Can http accept req bodyUser
- hit our api 5 per sec how do you handle it- request we get incremental value ,
  -  so if every request is new how to get incremental value- socket can be used

## Js 
- Cyclic rotation arrayArray [1234]Output [3412]
- Data types in js
- Coercin
- Pass by value and pass by reference
    - How we can achieve pass by Val in JS
- Immediately invoked fn in JS eg fun(){}()


## Html css
- Void element
## Mongo
- How do you handle join- using find then lookup

- Node architecture ?
- How multithreading works?
- How many task you can allocate to number of thread-depends on system cpu core if 8 max 8 thread can be allowed ?
- If you have more than 8 How to handle? 
- If two of the core failed How you handle ?
